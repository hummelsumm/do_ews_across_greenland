def ridgequantity(w,fs):

	"""RIDGEQUANTITY  The ``ridge quantity'' associated with a wavelet transform.

   WARNING: Type of ridge is here imposed to be "amplitude" (see the matlab version for extra choices).

   RQ,FW = RIDGEQUANTITY(W,FS) returns the ridge quantity RQ associated with the analytic wavelet transform W computed at frequencies FS. RQ is the same size as W. It also returns the transform frequency matrix FW. FW has the radian instantaneous frequency at each scale and is the same size as W.
